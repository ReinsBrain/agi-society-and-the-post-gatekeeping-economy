## Chapter 3 — Gatekeeping as the Default Failure Mode

### Why Power Concentrates Around Models, Data, and Compute

When a technology becomes foundational, control over its critical inputs tends to concentrate. In the case of AGI, those inputs are not merely capital or labor, but **models, data, and compute**. Each of these exhibits strong economies of scale, and together they form a reinforcing triad that naturally pushes toward centralization in the race for market dominance which guarantees stakeholder survival and their financial security. These are fundamental human urges which can provide great benefit for humanity at the outset, but are also problematic as the market matures and the monopolistic endgame is achieved.

Large‑scale models are expensive to train and benefit disproportionately from incremental improvements. High‑quality data is scarce, often proprietary, and accumulates advantages over time. Compute infrastructure requires massive upfront investment, specialized hardware, and continuous optimization. Once an organization gains a lead in all three, it can compound that advantage rapidly.

Absent deliberate counter‑design, the most likely outcome is that a small number of actors—typically large corporations—come to control the most capable systems. Access to AGI then shifts from being a general capability to a **licensed service**, mediated by terms of use, pricing tiers, and policy enforcement layers.

This is what makes gatekeeping the *default* failure mode. No conspiracy is required. The underlying economics push toward concentration even if every participant begins with good intentions.

### Corporate Concentration and the Rise of Permissioned Intelligence

Corporate gatekeeping does not usually present itself as exclusion. It presents itself as **convenience, reliability, and safety**. Centralized providers offer powerful models behind polished APIs, promising ease of use, compliance, and constant improvement. For many users, this is attractive and rational.

Over time, however, dependence deepens. Workflows, products, and even entire industries are built atop a small number of proprietary intelligence platforms. Switching costs rise. Alternatives struggle to compete, not because they are technically impossible, but because they lack equivalent data, distribution, or trust.

In this environment, intelligence becomes permissioned. What questions may be asked, which tools may be used, which domains are accessible, and which uses are forbidden are all determined upstream. Even well‑intentioned restrictions shape the boundaries of innovation. The danger is not censorship in a crude sense, but **constraint through dependency**.

As income displacement and demand collapse increase pressure on institutions, the temptation to accept such gatekeeping grows. When livelihoods and services depend on access to centralized AGI, resistance becomes costly.

### Government Nationalization as a False Solution

Faced with corporate concentration, a common response is to propose government ownership or nationalization of AGI. While this may appear to solve the access problem, it often replaces one form of gatekeeping with another.

Governments are not well suited to operate rapidly evolving, highly technical systems at the frontier of capability. Bureaucratic processes favor stability, risk minimization, and uniformity—traits that conflict with the experimental, pluralistic nature of innovation. Centralized public control can therefore lead to stagnation, politicization, or excessive precaution.

Moreover, a single government‑run AGI system still concentrates power. Decisions about access, priorities, and acceptable use become subject to political cycles, institutional inertia, and regulatory capture. The result may be broader access on paper, but narrower freedom in practice.

This is why nationalization should be understood not as a solution, but as a **failure mode of last resort**—one that may be necessary in extreme circumstances, yet carries its own long‑term risks.

### Historical Parallels: From Open Systems to Controlled Infrastructures

The pattern of initial openness followed by consolidation is familiar. Telecommunications began as fragmented networks before congealing into regulated monopolies. The internet was designed as a decentralized system, yet its economic layer became dominated by a small number of platforms. Cloud computing promised flexibility and democratization, but has largely concentrated control of compute in the hands of a few hyperscalers.

In each case, the technical architecture allowed decentralization, but the economic and institutional incentives favored centralization. AGI inherits this pattern, but with higher stakes. Intelligence is not merely infrastructure; it is a general‑purpose amplifier of power.

### Why Gatekeeping Follows Naturally From Parts I.1 and I.2

Income displacement weakens the bargaining position of individuals and institutions. Demand collapse increases reliance on large, stable providers. Together, they create conditions in which centralized control appears efficient, safe, and inevitable.

Gatekeeping is therefore not an aberration; it is the path of least resistance. Avoiding it requires intentional design choices that counteract scale advantages without halting progress. The remainder of this document explores such alternatives—federated architectures, distributed stewardship, and incentive structures that preserve access without collapsing into chaos or stagnation.
