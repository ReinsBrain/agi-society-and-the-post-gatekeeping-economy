# AGI, Society, and the Post‑Gatekeeping Economy
by Rein Petersen

As AGI erodes labor, this essay argues that the real crisis isn’t jobs — it’s participation — and outlines a federated, post-gatekeeping economy where humans remain indispensable stewards rather than passive dependents. It is a pragmatic roadmap for surviving AGI without surrendering human relevance, proposing new architectures, incentives, and governance models that preserve pluralism, dignity, and democratic resilience.
