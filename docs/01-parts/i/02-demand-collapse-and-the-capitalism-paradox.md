## Chapter 2 — Capitalism’s Dependence on Broad Purchasing Power

Modern capitalism is often described in terms of innovation, competition, and capital allocation. Beneath those dynamics, however, lies a simpler structural requirement: **mass purchasing power**. For most of the industrial and post‑industrial era, economic growth depended on a large population of wage earners who both produced goods and services and then consumed them.

This dual role created a self‑reinforcing loop. People earned wages through participation in production; those wages generated demand for goods and services; and that demand justified further investment and expansion. Even highly unequal systems preserved this loop by maintaining a sufficiently large middle and working class with disposable income. The system could tolerate inefficiencies, speculation, and inequality so long as **aggregate demand remained healthy**.

AGI threatens this equilibrium not by eliminating consumption entirely, but by **decoupling income from production** at scale.

When production becomes increasingly automated, output can grow without proportional human labor. Wages cease to track productivity, and income concentrates toward capital owners and a small, highly leveraged elite. At that point, the classical question arises: *who buys what is being produced?*

This is not a moral critique of capitalism. It is a structural observation. A system optimized for production efficiency can still fail if the mechanisms that generate demand are steadily eroded.

### What Happens When Production Decouples From Wages

In the early stages of automation, decoupling is subtle. Firms reduce headcount, but displaced workers often find employment elsewhere, or wages stagnate slowly enough that consumption patterns adjust. For a time, the system appears resilient.

AGI accelerates and broadens this decoupling. Fewer workers are required across many sectors simultaneously. New firms may be “born automated,” employing very few people from the outset. Productivity gains accrue rapidly, but unevenly.

At first, the effects may look positive: lower prices, higher margins, faster innovation, and increased output. Over time, however, a deeper imbalance emerges.

If income concentrates without circulating broadly, demand becomes brittle. Wealthy individuals and entities do not consume proportionally more goods as their income rises. Instead, they channel surplus into financial assets and seek returns through rent‑seeking and speculation. Meanwhile, the majority experiences wage stagnation or loss, reduced economic security, and declining discretionary spending.

The result is a paradox: **abundance without buyers**.

A common counter‑argument is that automation will make goods so cheap that income matters less. This holds for some categories—basic manufactured goods or certain services—but it fails structurally. Not all costs collapse. Housing, land, energy infrastructure, healthcare, education, and physical services remain constrained by scarcity, regulation, and physical presence. Even where marginal costs approach zero, total system costs remain, including capital investment, maintenance, energy, and governance.

More fundamentally, human needs extend beyond subsistence. Economic participation is not only about survival; it is about agency, choice, status, and the ability to shape one’s life. A society of passive consumers of ultra‑cheap goods is neither stable nor innovative.

### Why This Is a Structural, Not Cyclical, Problem

Traditional economic downturns are cyclical. Demand falls, production slows, employment drops, and policy intervention eventually restores balance. AGI‑driven demand collapse, by contrast, is **structural**.

The classical feedback loop—wages leading to demand, demand justifying investment, and investment creating jobs—weakens when investment no longer requires human labor at scale, growth can occur without expanding employment, and technological progress continuously reduces labor’s share of value creation.

Policy tools designed for cyclical downturns, such as stimulus spending, interest‑rate adjustments, or temporary support, may soften the impact. They do not, however, restore the underlying linkage between participation and demand.

Nor can societies rely on “new industries” to rescue demand in the way they once did. As discussed in Part I.1, AGI‑era industries may generate enormous value while employing very few people. Even if GDP rises, income distribution may not. This creates a widening gap between headline economic metrics and lived economic reality for most people.

Historically, such divergences produce social and political instability long before they self‑correct.

When demand weakens, societies face a powerful temptation to paper over the gap through subsidies, transfers, make‑work programs, or permanent income floors. Some of these tools may be necessary during transition. But if they become the primary mechanism sustaining demand, they risk eroding the dignity and agency associated with economic contribution.

This tension sets the stage for the dystopias explored in Part II: a welfare‑only society, corporate feudalism, or bureaucratic technocracy.

### The Core Paradox

Capitalism excels at allocating capital toward efficiency and innovation, and AGI dramatically amplifies that strength. Without deliberate redesign, however, the same force can undermine the social substrate capitalism relies on: **a population that both produces and participates**.

The paradox is not that automation destroys value, but that it can destroy *participation*.

Resolving this paradox does not require abandoning markets or innovation. It requires re‑introducing humans into the value loop in roles that cannot be cheaply automated, that scale with social need, and that are economically rewarded. The remainder of this document explores how federated architectures, expert stewardship, and incentive redesign can restore circulation without reverting to gatekeeping or stagnation.
